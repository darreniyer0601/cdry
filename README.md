Our team is CDRY, and our app is the answer to the currently oversaturated e-commerce marketplace. 

Companies across the world have done everything there is to do with selling their products online.
Now, Companies and consumers can level up their sales and purchases with, you guessed it, NFTs!

What it does
Using the NCR Business Service Platform, we created a highly scalable e-commerce site with customer and catalog APIâ€™s to handle user and product data within the cloud. With our minimalist UI, customers can easily add NFT investing into their daily routine and get experienced in the next generation of cryptocurrency.

How we built it
We used React to build the frontend, and Flask as well as GoLang to build the backend. Additionally, we also made use of the NCR API and deployed the backend on GCP. We built the app to be very flexible and easily hostable!
